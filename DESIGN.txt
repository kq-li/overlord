Overlord

Overview
	Central control system, allowing a master computer to issue commands to several
	slave computers.

	The program will either be a master program or a slave program, determined
	through inputs to a command line interface. Then, commands issued through the
	master program will be repeated on all the slave computers.

	
Technical Design
	Master Program
		Reads inputs from user
			String parsing
			
		Contains list of slave computers
			Linked or array list of dynamic size
			Binary search through slave IDs
		
		Sends commands to and receives output from slave connections
			Networking

	Slave Program
		Receives commands from master computer
			Networking

		Runs commands from and sends output to master computer
			Processes
			Networking
			Pipes


Reach Goals
	Additional modes
		Spy mode
			Slaves send all output (secretly) to master
